Hello, I'm Adrianna.

I'm a startup founder from Singapore who has spent considerable amounts of time working and living across India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and Bangladesh, with short stints in America, the UK and Hungary.

I started this site in 2002 to document some of the things that occupied me at the time â€” school, technology, dating, photography, travel. My interests, but for two, remain the same.

Here I'll start to write more about business, family, scifi and video games. I already have a Battlestar Galactica tattoo across my forearm, so it's clear which path that's going to lead us.
