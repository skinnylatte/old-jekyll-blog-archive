# Adrianna Tan

I’m a startup founder from Singapore who has spent considerable amounts of time working and living across India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and Bangladesh, with short stints in America, the UK and Hungary.

I started this site in 2002 to document some of the things that occupied me at the time — school, technology, dating, photography, travel. My interests, but for two, remain the same.
