As many of you will know by now, I have spent a substantial part of the past decade travelling through India. I still feel like I&#8217;m barely done with scratching the surface. There&#8217;s just so much to see in that vast, amazing country that I call my second home.

For some time now I&#8217;ve wanted to go to Coorg.

Coorg, also known as Kodagu, is a hill area in the state of Karnataka, in the Western Ghats. Its people are known as Kodavas (not Coorgis!) and all I knew about the place was that it had coffee, beautiful people, and pork curry. All that was sufficient to inspire me to plan a trip there.

From Chennai, I took a quick overnight train to Mysore Junction (book early, book ahead — this route is headed towards Bangalore, and therefore sells out early), but you can also take a bus. At Mysore Junction, I arranged for a car to pick me up for breakfast and to my resort of choice.

An acquaintance from Mysore highly recommended [Travelparkz](http://www.travelparkz.com/car/script/carpackages.php), and he was right: they were a very reliable car and driver service, and it was good value. I hired them for a pickup from Mysore Junction railway station to the resort in Coorg that I was headed to; and for a drop-off from the resort to Bangalore city a couple of days later. I highly recommend these guys, though it&#8217;s best to reach them via phone. They speak English.

I had heard about [The Tamara](http://www.thetamara.com) from friends in Bangalore, so I decided I would give it a shot. It&#8217;s a very new place and it gets most things right. My only complaint is it didn&#8217;t have as much pork as I would have liked.

You can wander about the grounds of The Tamara on your own, or sign up for one of their daily walks with their on-site naturalist. I did none of the above as I was too busy resting after a long week at work in India!

Highly recommended. I will be returning to Coorg shortly, although I may want to check out  [Victory Home](http://victoryhome.net) next, since I&#8217;ve just met these guys in Bangalore.

Damn I love this country.
