**Closure of donation drive: TWC2 will stop collecting donations for the victims of the #downtownlinetragedy tonight (Friday 27 July 2012, 2359hrs). For more information [please read this link](http://popagandhi.com/2012/07/downtownlinetragedy-donation-drive-to-close-tonight/)**

**Edit:** The Paypal link we previously posted isn&#8217;t working. To donate via Paypal, please to go the [donate page](http://twc2.org.sg/getinvolved/donate/) on TWC&#8217;s website, and click the Paypal icon there.

**Clarification:** Questions have been raised in various comments about the commission we mention here. Just to be clear, the commissions are charged by the various online payment platforms. We do not receive a single cent or even come close to looking at it. It&#8217;s all run through a registered non-profit.

It is with a heavy heart that I write this post. This morning, we awoke to tragic news that two workers had died while building the Downtown Line in Bugis. They were buried alive by cement while pouring wet concrete into a mould. The scaffolding collapsed. They were stuck in the cement and the rescuers had some difficulty prying their bodies out. Investigations are now saying that the wet concrete was almost as heavy as a swimming pool. ([link](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1214308/1/.html)) Whatever the outcome, and whatever its impact on our labour practices will be, there is simply no other way to put this: these guys came here to build our nation, often at great risk to their lives.

Singapore is what it is today because of the migrant workers that have built our structures, poured our wet cement while we were sleeping, dug and laid our roads. It was true when it was [Samsui women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsui_women) doing that, and it is even more true now that we have migrant workers from China, Mongolia, India, Bangladesh and other countries coming here in droves in search of a better life, offering their services to us at minimal cost and maximum risk.

As [Miyagi said](http://miyagi.sg/2012/07/help-the-workers-who-help-build-our-country/), these guys are doing our national service.

A bunch of us spent all of this afternoon trying to figure out how we can do our part to help. We spoke with various government ministries, who are doing what they can on their part, and to organizations. The organization [Transient Workers Count Too](http://twc2.org.sg/), which promotes equitable treatment for migrant workers in Singapore, stepped in. They&#8217;ve offered to take in donations for the victims. I must stress that as a non-profit registered under the Societies Act with experience in managing and disbursing donations, they have the structures and practices in place that Miyagi, mrbrown and I do not have. If you have queries about the accounting practices and methods of fund disbursement, feel free to reach out.

In the meantime, what we would like to do is to create an avenue for those of you who want to help to do so. The money goes towards the families of the two deceased workers, as well as to the injured workers who are unable to work while they recover.
