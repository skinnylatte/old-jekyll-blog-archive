I&#8217;ve been having way too much fun in Helsinki, and also writing offline about it, but I promise I&#8217;ll write more about it soon. I&#8217;m now in Stockholm, about to assemble my bike and go out in search of some of this city&#8217;s best sights (and there are a lot of them). For now, some pictures!

_A peek into my sim card collection._

_The view from where I would jog in Helsinki._

_I&#8217;ve met lots of people in Helsinki, including tech types._

_Eaten some delicious food, like **sapas** and blue cheese bread from Juuri._

_Done some weird things._

_And weirder things._

_I < 3 kids._

I really should get on with writing about it (I do want to), and with figuring out a way to display all my pictures inline in a clever-er way!

Bottom line: Helsinki has been absolutely amazing, and I&#8217;ve been reluctant to leave it. I haven&#8217;t felt that way about a &#8216;new&#8217; place in a while.
