  1. I&#8217;ve moved to Jakarta to take part in [Ideabox](http://ideabox.co.id) with my startup, [WoBe](http://wobe.io)
  2. I&#8217;m writing more on [Medium](http://medium.com/@skinnylatte) these days. The blog format is unsatisfactory to me at the moment
  3. Over there, I&#8217;ve started two collections which may be interesting to some of you. In &#8220;[The Java Diaries](https://medium.com/the-java-diaries)&#8220;, I obsessively track my time in Jakarta in the name of learning. In &#8220;[Myanmar&#8217;s Second Wind](https://medium.com/myanmars-second-wind/latest)&#8220;, I write about my year in Yangon and the people I&#8217;ve met there, from the tech entrepreneur&#8217;s point of view
  4. Know someone fun or interesting in Jakarta? I would love to meet them
  5. What does one do with a blog these days?
