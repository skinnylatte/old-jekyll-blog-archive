If this looks bare to you, it's supposed to be.

I've just finished archiving all of my old posts and giving them some new life as something else they're not: cool.

By using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), this setup lets me edit the site in a way I must prefer now: with a [text editor](https://atom.io) and `git`.

Most things are still here, and I'll add to it shortly.

But sometimes less is more.

If you're into that sort of thing, [check out my repo](https://github.com/skinnylatte/skinnylatte.github.io)!
