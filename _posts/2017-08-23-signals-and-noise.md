I've been on the internet for a <em>very long time</em>, but my online self really only found its home when I got this domain in 2003. 14 years: enough to see blogs decline into the mushy wasteland that is Medium articles, video in every website we now load, and a million apps to help me connect with everything that we love. I've led a hectic online life outside of this blog, but at the end I keep wanting to come back to see what I can do with it.

Lately, I've had circumstances that forced some introspection, such as the following:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want to talk about the unglamorous bits of being a startup founder. 1/many</p>&mdash; Adrianna Tan (@skinnylatte) <a href="https://twitter.com/skinnylatte/status/892659869622296576">August 2, 2017</a></blockquote>

Everything worth doing, to me, are still the difficult ones. Sometimes it's hard to hear through the noise.
