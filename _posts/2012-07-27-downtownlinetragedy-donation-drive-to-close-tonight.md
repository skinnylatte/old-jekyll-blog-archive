The donation drive for last week&#8217;s #downtownlinetragedy victims will close tonight, Fri­day, 27 July, at 2359hrs.

If dona­tions marked “Bugis MRT acci­dent” arrive by cheque after the dead­line and includes contact information, TWC2 will email the donor to ask whether he/she would like a refund or if the donation should be put towards the organization’s gen­eral fund. Refunds, should you select that option, will be made promptly.

If how­ever the dona­tion is received after the dead­line marked “Bugis MRT acci­dent” but with­out any con­tact infor­ma­tion, the dona­tion will be accepted into the organization’s gen­eral fund.

Thank you so much, kind souls in Singapore, for showing all of us that Singapore still has plenty of compassion, empathy and dignity.
