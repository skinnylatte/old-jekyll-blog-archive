I&#8217;m seated now by the side of an old vending machine in Jakarta airport, with power sockets so dirty and old I had to think twice about plugging my cables in. Yet in all of Terminal 1, one of the oldest airport terminals in a country not known for modern aviation facilities, there was only this one socket free. Confined to my fate of temporarily sharing power with a giant Teh Botol (not Coke!) machine with no seat within range of my Macbook charger, I am, obviously, on the floor yet again.

Sitting on floors: a practice cultivated in many countries across the world. Sometimes involuntary, most of the time because my inner hippie wants me to. The difference between now and then — I am now at the kind of age where you would, if you did not know me, expect some kind of manners from me. Wear proper clothes, wear proper shoes. Sit on proper surfaces. I imagined I would too! That one day, I would finally learn how to be _proper_. How wrong I was on that, and many other fronts! I am happy to _still-sitting-on-dirty-floors_. No — I am overjoyed. Overjoyed to be still a _chapalang, anyhow_ and _anyhowly chapalang_ person.

So much has happened since the last real post of any substance here. Mid, early 2014 perhaps. I started a company. It still lives. I have teams, collaborators, all across my different endeavours. The foundation I started in 2012 is still alive, too. I am relieved and grateful for all of the opportunities thrown my way, all of the paths revealed and then some.

Why did I not write? I did not write, because life overwhelmed me and kept me away and sometimes light-headed. I did not write, because I forgot how to. It isn&#8217;t like riding a bicycle — it&#8217;s more of riding a unicycle where you know eventually you&#8217;ll find your balance but only after falling flat on your face anyway, no matter how many times you&#8217;ve ridden one. In my pursuit of achievements, exceptional or otherwise, prizes, awards, Silicon Valley-style work yourself to the bone for some big undefined payoff (emotional or otherwise); I lost myself in the race. I lost myself, too, in the unclear idea of what it meant to be an adult.

An adult, I was told, lived in a proper house with a proper bed with a proper pillow (for all of the neck pains you&#8217;re bound to have). I have neck pains, indeed, but realise I can do without all of the rest. I haven&#8217;t sat on dirty airport floors for years. I haven&#8217;t gone somewhere with nothing in my bag other than the clothes currently on me, in years. I haven&#8217;t gone somewhere without a plan, without a place to stay, without any idea of what i was going to do. I don&#8217;t know how else to live, and forcing myself into being the opposite of those things brought me further and further away from who I really was.

Maybe this year, after learning to like myself again, I&#8217;ll finally get my groove back again. I&#8217;m proud to be an _anyhowly_ person. I&#8217;m proud to extreme and spontaneous. I will no longer knead the image of who I truly am into the uninspiring ideas of what some people had wanted me to become. I don&#8217;t want to achieve things for the sake of doing that — I want to learn to be alive, again. Let&#8217;s see how we go on this journey, I&#8217;m excited but also shit-scared about it.

But as I once believed (when I was much younger) — if it doesn&#8217;t scare me like hell, it probably isn&#8217;t worth doing.
