Fuck Medium. Seriously.

I have had enough of their terrible user interface, narrow writing experience, and the empty platitudes of &#8216;recs&#8217; and comments from people looking to improve their lives by reading inspiring content from people they don&#8217;t care about. Worst of all? I hate people whining about Millennials more than Millennials themselves.

I started this site precisely so that I could tinker around under the hood, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve missed — tinkering. Writing. Slapping together bits of random code you find on the internet (now forking random folks&#8217; code on Github) and hoping it would work. I know a lot more about code and development processes now, but I still gain a huge amount of happiness from tinkering with things I don&#8217;t know.

My archives are in a mess. I stopped writing here some time circa 2010. I don&#8217;t know why. Life took over. I got lazy. I got fed up trying to do everything at once.

It might take some time to gather the things I posted on different parts of the web. But it should be worth it 🙂
