excerpt: Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, Skinnskatteberg, Malmö, Copenhagen. Once in a while, I enjoy diving deep into places I know nothing about. I have a good feeling about this trip. (Also, is this the start of real-time travel blogging for me?)

Somewhere between lying in a hospital bed, travelling, and coming back to a hospital again, I decided: _man, I really need to go away._ I knew that my default go-to place was India. Until it wasn&#8217;t.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still love India very much and it still holds a special place in my heart, as the one country that has given me much, but in 8 years of intensive India travel it is no longer &#8220;a destination I know nothing about&#8221; type of experience. India is a home I go back to, in grief and in celebration, and always will; I just needed to flirt briefly with other countries and climes, and so I will.

Tomorrow, I depart for Helsinki. After that, Tallinn, Stockholm, Skinnskatteberg, Malmö, Copenhagen. I know I said in my previous post that I needed to slow down, and learn to live again — this is exactly my idea of slowing down. It sounds mad, but I have a plan.

Ever since the hospital, I&#8217;ve stopped smoking and drinking, even casually. Even if not life-threatening, the episode convinced me that I wanted to do more with my life, where lifestyle was concerned — it also convinced me that I wanted to see more of the outdoors. I&#8217;ve been cycling, running, and cycling even more. I will bring my bicycle with me to the Nordic states (yes, I know I can rent bicycles there… but. I want _my_ bicycle! Not somebody&#8217;s else&#8217;s!), and I will get to enjoy the onset of spring in some of the best cities in the world for bicycle commuting.

I don&#8217;t know what to expect: I know so little about that part of the world. The only thing I know for certain is I will be cold. I&#8217;ve prepared for it, but I&#8217;ve never been in that type of cold until now, so I&#8217;m just going to have to make it up as I go. I&#8217;ll be completely shut off from work for a while, which will be the first time in some years. I will be completely shut off from the world, and the world wide web, for a couple of days, too, which will be the first time… since I discovered the world wide web. Work-wise, I&#8217;m excited about that part of the world as it&#8217;s the land of Spotify, Angry Birds, Minecraft — some of my favourite things in the world — along with awesome salmon and [mesost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunost), which I also love. I spent 3 all too brief days in Stockholm in 2010, and now I&#8217;m going to be back there, in the company of friends this time with the possibility of [a superb dinner](http://www.frantzen-lindeberg.com/en).

I can&#8217;t wait.
