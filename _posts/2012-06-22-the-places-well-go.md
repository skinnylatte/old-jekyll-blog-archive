_Cow on Limestone Kiln, Meghalaya, 2006_

Five years ago, [I said](http://popagandhi.com/2007/02/chasing-the-monsoon/): &#8220;Ask me again a year, three, or five from now and all I will remember is driving up, around, up, around, up, around, in the swirling clouds as the rain lashed at my windows and I feared for my life, balanced so daintily in this tin can navigating itself on the hairpin road.&#8221;

Plenty has changed, these five years, but at least this part remains familiar: &#8220;Ask me again a year, three, or five from now and I will still tell you the same thing: I’m not sure why I do the things that I do.&#8221; Then, I was referring to the heady, exciting days of a student who had the chance to criss-cross across the hill tribes of northeast India and investigate the ailments of rural Bangladeshis suffering from leprosy, TB and lymphatic filiarisis. I got to go on the amazing adventure of my life, never really expecting it to end. It hasn&#8217;t.

Much has changed, but adventure has never left me.

The last five months have been tumultuous. It was the sort of chaos that was ultimately a blip in the universe (though still a large one), and not, thankfully, the sort that led to destruction and the end of the world as I knew it.

In a few days I will make that trip to Kuala Lumpur for the last time. It will be awkward. On it, I will return to the apartment I&#8217;ve had for two years, but haven&#8217;t lived in for the last five months, and I will assemble everything that I own in that city and that country, and pack it into several boxes. I last packed all the things I owned in the universe into several boxes under far happier circumstances. This time I pack a dog into the car, too.

I don&#8217;t regret a moment. Life has dealt me a pretty good lot, and I have milked it for what it&#8217;s worth. So from Singapore to Dubai and the Middle East to London to Kuala Lumpur I now find myself surprisingly, but not that much, in Singapore. I left a Singapore I didn&#8217;t like very much, and returned to a Singapore I absolutely love (there&#8217;s an essay in that somewhere). You can&#8217;t come home again, but you can definitely make it home again, for the first time.

The single life is interesting, but difficult, in equal parts. I haven&#8217;t dated in such a long time, I really don&#8217;t have it in me anymore.

The life with hyperthyroid is worse.

_I can&#8217;t remember shit._ I quite literally feel like I&#8217;ve lost a major chunk of my former cognitive abilities. It sucks.

How am I dealing with all of this? I&#8217;m… dealing. If you know me in real life, you probably can&#8217;t tell. I&#8217;ve worked very hard to keep it invisible. My heart rate still goes nuts. I drop a ton of weight or I put it back and I drop it again. I am manic and then I am exhausted. I am utterly intolerant to heat, even in an air-conditioned room I am _hot_. I don&#8217;t need any medical diagnosis here (I am actively under the care of the medical professionals here, no worries). I just wish I could get my memory back. I&#8217;ve gone from one of those people with super memories to one of those who has to scribble down _everything_. I don&#8217;t remember people I&#8217;ve just met (this has never happened before), I don&#8217;t remember even meeting them, most of the time. It&#8217;s amazing I can even work at all.

The last five months have felt like a massive blur. I feel like time and space has compressed for me. Or that I&#8217;m living in a time warp, splitting myself between two universes. One: pre-illness, pre-breakup, pre-everything. When life was, I thought, sorted. For the time being. The second one, the one I inhabit right now: plagued by a disease that doesn&#8217;t threaten but bothers me, learning to find my feet again without the woman I love and the life and businesses we had. Breaking up gets more and more expensive as you get older.

I&#8217;m okay, I&#8217;m good, I&#8217;m pretty happy (seriously) — I was just telling someone that I thrive in change in ways that many people don&#8217;t understand, but I do. Change works for me.

I should be more careful what I wish for, you know? Now there&#8217;s _so much of it_ I am still finding my feet, but I&#8217;m not sure how. That suits me fine for now.

It&#8217;s just that I hate packing.
