1. I must watch too many scifi movies. I&#8217;d rarely been convinced of the malleability of time, but these days I measure out everything in two-week units. Time seems to race ahead of me. It always has, now more than before. 

2. When I say _these days_, I don&#8217;t mean it facetiously. Yes, I turn _just_ 27 in a couple of months, but I feel old, cranky and grumpy most of the time, especially around younger people. This must be what growing old feels like at first, not with a bang but with a grumpy whimper. 

3. I must tell my endocrinologist about my worsening memory loss problems. If only I didn&#8217;t keep forgetting. I will set it as a Reminder in my iPhone, and tell it to alert me when I enter the hospital. I must also set another one to remind me of the same thing as I&#8217;m leaving the hospital, because… I really worry that I&#8217;m losing my mind.

4. Walking away is hard. One would think you&#8217;d get used to it, after having done it _so many times_, but it doesn&#8217;t get any easier. It sounds base, but it&#8217;s when you pack up an apartment with all your physical possessions into many, many boxes and bags, and load them into the back of a car at 5am, that seems to be when reality bores into your thick, numb skull. I&#8217;ll remember next time.

5. Life has taken on an interesting turn. I&#8217;ve had to scale back on life and ambition in some ways, because I literally cannot remember things, and physically cannot do some of those things. I&#8217;ve undoubtedly become a new convert to the &#8220;quality of life&#8221; school of thought when it comes to work. That part I&#8217;m scaling up on. 

Some new favourite lifehacks: putting my phone on Airplane mode and not turning it on until I get to work, not checking email until I get to work, bringing a book to read in the bus so I spend more time reading books than email, reading and buying more physical books than ebooks, doing things differently (like buying an orange notebook instead of a black one), making it a point to take the women of my family out to lunch every Monday, among other things. All of it sounds trivial now that I write it down, but I&#8217;m also at that point in my life where I favour incremental, trivial changes over the huge coming-at-you-with-a-mack-truck changes I used to favour (mostly of the &#8220;I&#8217;m leaving the country for an indefinite period!&#8221; variety)…

6. I&#8217;ve started making some tentative steps back into the world of meeting and dating interesting people. There have been many interesting people. But. c.f. point #2: I&#8217;m just older and grumpier these days, so you can imagine how that&#8217;s going. 

Also, I have transformed into a crazy dog lady whose primary concern in life for the next 110 days is to spend as much time with her quarantined dog as she possibly can. I feel about as attractive as anybody who smells of dog kennels most of the time can be.

7. Singapore has been really good to me since I came home. In some ways it feels like I never really left. I&#8217;m surrounded by incredible people in my industry who inspire me and others; I&#8217;m around people who really do walk the talk. It may or may not be naive optimism inspired by my homecoming, but I am so excited by what I see around me now in Singapore. My calendar of projects and events has filled up at a good pace. At this point, I have a _just nice_ amount on my plate. It helps.

8. The hardest part about breaking up with anybody is walking away from the memories of what you once wanted to accomplish together. I may feel like I&#8217;m losing my mind and my memory, but this isn&#8217;t one of those that I&#8217;ve lost.

If only it were.
