**Five Places I Visited and Loved in the Past 12 Months**

  1. Helsinki
  2. Copenhagen
  3. San Francisco
  4. New York City
  5. Stockholm

**Five Things I Learned in the Past 3 Months**

  1. Diving
  2. Swimming<superscript>*</superscript>
  3. Git
  4. Ruby
  5. Still looking for the fifth big thing. For now it looks like it&#8217;s going to be Fightshape

<superscript>*</superscript>Note: I could swim, but badly. I took up [Shaw Method](http://artofswimming.com/) swim lessons to dramatically improve my technique and confidence.

**Five Things I Bought Recently**

  1. A 27&#8243; [Korean IPS monitor](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/the-ips-lcd-revolution.html) (A Yamakasi Catleap Multi)
  2. [Steelcase Leap](http://www.steelcase.com/en/products/category/seating/task/leap/pages/overview.aspx)
  3. A [Sony NEX-5](http://www.sony.com.sg/productcategory/nex-camera) with 16mm lens
  4. Xbox 360 with Kinect and many amazing games (Assassin&#8217;s Creed! Borderlands 2! Dishonored! Wow)
  5. [Das Keyboard](http://www.daskeyboard.com/)

**Five Challenges I Will Soon Tackle**

  1. Advanced diving course with many specialties
  2. A job
  3. A hopeful transformation into a real programmer
  4. A massive overhaul/redesign/ renovation of my room in Singapore. It needs to look less like a place that 12 year old me once lived in.
  5. Another tattoo

And at some point, a haircut, too. And a piece of fiction.

Oh shit.
