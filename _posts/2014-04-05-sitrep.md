  1. I got a Battlestar Galactica tattoo
  2. I&#8217;m pretty pleased about that
  3. It&#8217;s one half of the pair of wings and Caprica constellation that Starbuck gets when she marries Anders
  4. Within a couple of hours of getting it, a random stranger proposed to me â€” saying she would get &#8220;the other side&#8221;
  5. Which would be romantic, but that would also mean (a) she&#8217;s a Cylon (b) we&#8217;d have a tumultuous relationship (c) she&#8217;d better be damn good at Pyramids
  6. It&#8217;s unbelievable that 10 years has passed since I first started to watch this show
  7. I don&#8217;t generally fan-girl anything, but this was special
  8. I identify with Starbuck in far too many ways, if you know what I mean
  9. It&#8217;s potentially far more meaningful than anything else I could have gotten
 10. After getting this done I do kinda feel like nothing can frak with my qi

I love BSG.
