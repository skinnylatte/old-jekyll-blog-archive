I&#8217;m home now of course, whatever home means, and I&#8217;ve been retelling a couple of stories. The same ones, but many of them, just because I&#8217;ve had such a crazy time in the Nordics.

This one isn&#8217;t very much of a story. Just a little tale that, once again, shows you how crazy we Asians are about our food.

I spent the first three weeks of my big Scandinavian/Finnish vacation on my own, and/or with friends from that region. In the last week, a friend from uni came to meet me in Copenhagen.

We did stuff, mostly in this order:

Eat. Drink. Eat. Drink. Eat. Cycle. Eat. Drink. Eat. Bring our bicycles to Sweden.

To buy chocolate cake. From a supermarket. She&#8217;d been on student exchange in Sweden, now lived in Geneva, and missed Swedish supermarket chocolate cake terribly. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s nice and all, but damn if I ever go to another country to buy chocolate cake again.
