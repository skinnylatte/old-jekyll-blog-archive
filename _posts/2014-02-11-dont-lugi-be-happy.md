In peninsular Southeast Asia there is a word of Malay origin, bastardized by Chinese pronunciation that perhaps best describes the prevalent mindset of the middle class in everything from career to politics: lugi.

More than the losing of face and the losing of status, our collective great fear is the fear of losing out. What of? Anything and everything. A recent history of imperialism, colonialism, authoritarianism and other forms of oppression have perhaps conditioned our brains into a state of perpetual loss. And need for perpetual validation.

Our toddlers go for a dozen classes, academic and non-academic, before they even learn to independently put on their pants. Other people&#8217;s kids may win, you see.

It is not enough to get a perfect score at the &#8220;O&#8221; Levels, scoring a total of 6 points (the fewer the better, 6 being the lowest); to qualify for the top three schools one must have enough point deductions from higher second language, sports and activities, and alumni affiliation, so you&#8217;re really aiming for 0 points.

To what end, paper pushers and PowerPoint warriors?

The most successful people I know who have emerged from this Matrix ask a different set of questions.

They do not ask, &#8220;what can I lose by doing this?&#8221;

They ask, &#8220;what can I gain?&#8221; Then proceed to minimize the risks through calculated steps and methodologies.

They do not ask, &#8220;how can this help me be seen to be more successful by my peers?&#8221;

They ask, &#8220;how does this help me learn, build, make a life I want for myself, help others, and can it also afford the life that I want such that my peers can see economic success attained through healthy, self-deterministic ways?&#8221;

They do not understand the politics of lugi and perhaps it is because some of us do not understand fear; every challenge is a learning curve to be conquered.

Of course this is a privilege of a certain socio-economic class, perhaps an indulgence, but for anyone of an aspirational mindset the fear of losing out is the biggest death knell you can sound. It&#8217;s not a competition, but even if it was you&#8217;d better be competing because you love it, not because you&#8217;re trapped in a race whose rules you don&#8217;t understand and whose finish line offers an indeterminate prize you&#8217;ll figure out later. Life&#8217;s too short to be afraid.
