If you are anything like me, you&#8217;ve walked by Peninsula Plaza all the time and perhaps even entered it when you&#8217;ve needed to buy cameras and stuff. You&#8217;ve probably also wondered about all the wondrous things there. What is the paste they are mixing, what is this delicious-looking food and how can I have some of it, if only I knew what to order?

I&#8217;ve had the luck to spend more time in Myanmar in recent times, and I absolutely adore the country. I figured it would be only fitting to feature the community in Singapore for the next [Culture Kitchen](http://culturekitchen.sg), seeing as that _there&#8217;s an entire building in downtown Singapore_ that caters to that community.

With a bunch of intrepid volunteers&#8217; help, I&#8217;m happy to announce Culture Kitchen 2: Little Myanmar. We&#8217;ll have lunch featuring the best-of Burmese cuisine, you&#8217;ll get to meet and mingle with the Burmese community, we&#8217;ll also screen &#8220;The City Where They Live&#8221;, a documentary about Meiktila&#8217;s community and youth leaders and how they worked to heal the city after the horrific communal violence of 2013. We&#8217;ll then do a Q&A with the filmmakers live from Yangon before kicking off a walking tour of Little Myanmar.

Sound good? Get your tickets [here](http://peatix.com/event/30159/view), there are just 19 seats left.
