                            <h2><a href="/2013/12/little-india-urban-renewal-plan/">Little India Urban Renewal Plan</a></h2>

                            <div class="excerpt">
                                <p>I believe an urban renewal and community reorganization of the Little India precinct can achieve the following: (a) the creation of public spaces to be shared by Singaporeans, residents, tourists and transient workers alike (b) the improvement of law and order without the draconian hand of law (c) lead to an increase in utility and happiness among the residents and voters who live there and the workers who make it their home every Sunday.</p>

<p>An 8-point urban renewal and community reorganization program:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Two small bus bays on either ends of Little India with staggered time slots for arrivals and departures for the Sunday visitors; special EZ-link style cards to be issued just to workers to expedite boarding and remove sources of conflict between drivers, conductors and workers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two drop-in centres on either ends of Little India staffed by grassroots volunteers in the Moulmein-Kallang GRC who have the power to escalate issues of grave concern (such as the non-payment of salaries and other labour abuses) to the relevant personnel at the ministries; and the empathy to refer smaller problems to the relevant non-profits who can help</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prepaid SIM cards targeted at Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani workers should come with pre-programmed hotline numbers to the drop-in centres. The universities can provide a source of volunteers for their community service requirements. Students who speak or are learning Bengali, Hindi, Urdu and Tamil should be given preference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amateur cricket tournament or league can be held at the fields in Little India or even at the stadium.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Participating F&amp;B outlets can be part of an association of Friends of Little India. Singaporeans and residents who are part of the program can pledge to give an additional $1 each time they visit, which goes into a giant pot for Sunday food. Workers can buy a nourishing meal at a discounted rate of $1 or $2, subsidized by the consumers in the program</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Free monthly walks around Little India run by volunteers. Community centres around Singapore should be encouraged to book walks so their residents are able to experience a different culture and become familiar with Little India.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A mobile library with books and magazines from Bangladesh and Tamil Nadu to start with. Later on, an expansion of library program could mean short certificate-granting courses that can be supported by govt agencies interested in productivity and labour skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A monthly outdoor movie screening which shows Tamil, Bengali and Hindi movies, programming to be determined.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Idealistic? Yes. How to find the money? Dunno also. I don’t think being cynical or apathetic to this is going to do very much good either.</p>

<p>For now I will continue to work on whatever I can do, in very very tiny steps.</p>

                            <h2><a href="/2013/12/the-real-singapore-conversations/">The Real Singapore Conversations</a></h2>

                            <div class="excerpt">
                                <p><em>I posted this on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/adrianna.tan/posts/10153588292645265">Facebook</a> the night of the incident. Re-posting this here for posterity.</em></p>

<p>Projects like <a href="http://culturekitchen.sg">Culture Kitchen</a> — and a few more up my sleeve — began with the uneasy realisation that something was amiss in Singapore as I knew it. Was it that it was crowded? Bursting at the seams? Was it that amongst that crowd we now no longer knew each other’s names? That our old ways — of easy categorisation, institutionalized racial profiling swept under a veneer of “open, meritocratic Singapore where anybody and everybody can succeed” — no longer held true? That our old social contracts: shut up, take the money, no longer applied when the money ran out?</p>

<p>The truth was we were blind to our shortcomings. We are the nerd that made it to the top of the class and is somewhat cool now but won’t ever discuss the things we’re not good at, like, brooking dissent. Or criticism. Or opinion.</p>

<p>When the immigration floodgates were cast wide open for nearly a decade, we were told: “We got it.”</p>

<p>When our planners believed demography to be a function of race and ethnicity instead — when we believed for a second there that as long as we brought in the *correct* type of people, social cohesion would follow — we did not have a voice.</p>

<p>When our infrastructure creaked under the weight of all of the people we did not expect, we realised that train lines not only do not build themselves quite quickly enough: people also do not build ties with each other quite enough.</p>

<p>When popular and political opinion turned, the same people who told us they got this told us they still got this, and now chased the people who came to build a home away.</p>

<p>And we the people failed to reach out to each other to learn that despite what we felt about our government, that should not really matter: oppose the policy, not the people who came here.</p>

<p>The last time in our history there were overturned vehicles and fires was at the very start of our journey as a Republic.</p>

<p>Tonight the vehicles burn for different reasons: the episodes are incomparable.</p>

<p>Yet it will, mark my words, point to yet another turning point — the start of a real national soul-searching, this time as a Republic in a mid-life crisis.</p>

<p>Earlier today the ruling party attempted to search its soul. I personally believe it is struggling to define its continued leadership role in a Singapore that is evolving faster than it is.</p>

<p>When shit hit the fan and (anecdotally) my friends of minority races and nationalities faced open hostility in my country, both physical and verbal, we were told: “we got this.”</p>

<p>But tonight I urge all of you — Singaporeans, Singapore residents, foreign workers, anybody who cares about Singapore in any shape or form no matter where you live or what colour your passport and identity card is — to help us rise above racism and blame and xenophobia because as we have seen tonight, the first riot in decades is taking hours to wind down even in the most controlled city in the world. But when it is all over, I think we need to have an honest conversation with ourselves — the real Singapore Conversation. Not the sanitised version.</p>

<p>Don’t let them say they got this. Whether or not they’ve got this is of no great import. It’s that we can no longer afford to sit on the sidelines while someone else puts out the flames, in every sense, that is.</p>

<p>It’s all over folks. Here’s what we do know for sure. (I stayed up for the press conference)</p>

<p>– A fatal accident involving a Singaporean bus driver and an Indian national sparked off a riot (about 400 people)</p>

<p>– The call was made at 9.23pm. It was resolved within an hour.</p>

<p>– 27 suspects from South Asian countries (did not say where: good call) were arrested</p>

<p>– No Singaporeans were involved in the rioting</p>

<p>– The deceased is a 33 year old Indian national. Condolences to his family.f</p>

<p>– 300 police officers responded</p>

<p>– Gurkhas and special ops were involved</p>

<p>– This was a case of ‘rioting with dangerous weapons’</p>

<p>– They didn’t say what. But mentioned glass bottles being thrown.</p>

<p>– This was not premeditated</p>

<p>– Bus driver not arrested. Further arrests to be made.</p>

<p>– No weapons were fired. Maximum restraint was used. (Good job Home Team)</p>

<p>– Explosions were caused by burning vehicles</p>

<p>– Projectiles were thrown at rescuers who were trying to extricate body from under bus</p>

<p>– Riot sparked after the bus was pelted following the accident</p>

<p>– Police will investigate all aspects, including the accident</p>

<p>– DPM Teo says those involved will be dealt with fairly, firmly, strictly, in accordance with the law</p>

<p>– Police will step up in areas where ‘foreigners congregate’ (I’m sure they don’t mean Marina Bay Sands)</p>

<p>Stats:</p>

<p>– Stats: 10 police, 4 SCDF officers injured; bus driver and conductor in hospital, 2 “unaccounted for” (waiting to hear what this means).</p>

<p>– 9 SCDF vehicles damaged, 5 vehicles burned</p>

<p>– Private vehicles were also damaged. Unclear if this count is included in the above, or separate</p>

<p>Please keep the families of the deceased and injured in your prayers. When we wake up tomorrow we should ask ourselves some hard questions, and if you think that’s just something that happens with “foreigners” and “those people”, I implore you to think harder.</p>

                            <div class="excerpt">
                                <p>Update: About 20 minutes after posting this, news erupted that <em><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/three-busloads-police-officers-riot-gear-respond-rioting-mob-little-in">this</a></em> had happened. I will be posting a second part to this piece shortly.</p>

<p>The nation waited with bated breath to see what our ruling party would emerge with after the much-anticipated party convention this Sunday. Titled “Our New Way Forward, A Call to Action”, the People’s Action Party was set to define among its cadres how it would tackle the challenges it — the PAP, not Singapore — faces.</p>

<p>They emerged with 8 points (<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pap-adopts-8-point/914398.html">link</a>).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dedicate themselves to serving the nation and advancing the well-being and interests of Singaporeans.</li>
  <li>Strengthen the Singaporean identity, where people of different races, religions and backgrounds live harmoniously together for a better Singapore.</li>
  <li>Create opportunities for all Singaporeans to build a better life.</li>
  <li>Called for sustaining a vibrant economy, enabling quality jobs and improving living standards for all.</li>
  <li>Uphold an open and meritocratic system, so that everyone has opportunities to fulfil his or her potential.</li>
  <li>Strive to preserve social mobility so that all Singaporeans, regardless of social backgrounds, can achieve success in diverse fields through their efforts.</li>
  <li>Build a fair and just society, where the benefits of progress are shared with all Singaporean</li>
  <li>Resolved to be a responsive and responsible government — responsive to tackle immediate challenges, and responsible to look beyond the immediate and create long term, sustained success for Singapore.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, the party resolved to do everything exactly what it has resolved to do since 1959 (give or take a few communists here and there).</p>

<p>Given that it’s a party convention and it is not election season, this was not a time to create a manifesto or debate policy, I get that. It was a time to affirm its core values, which it has. It was also a time to acknowledge its challenges and internally decide how it can evolve to meet them. It appears they chose the path of taking on those challenges — head on.</p>

<p>It’s a little puzzling that the mouthpiece chosen to address exactly this should be that shining light of the PAP’s fourth-generation politician, Chan Chun Sing.</p>

<p>Our political process is addicted to our military men turned Prime Ministers and top leaders, which is all well and good (well, not really but that’s another story for another day), until you realise that military men never lose their uniforms.</p>

<p>Chan Chun Sing wants to do battle. On every street corner. Every cyberspace corner. In mass media. Social media. And so forth (<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pap-will-make-sure-s/914432.html">link</a>). With you. What’s more, he will not concede the space — physical or cyber. At all. Just before that he was saying the PAP had to improve its communications…</p>

<p>What’s wrong with this picture here?</p>

<p>Vocabulary is everything. Thus far our leaders have demonstrated an outsized inability to understand just how they don’t understand the media. Used to owning the message right through to the last soundbite through old forms of media control, that ship has long sailed and they do not understand they are no longer even on the boat. Their ministers struggle to explain themselves, even with well-meaning messages. Politicians of all people should understand the importance of the soundbite. The difference that vocabulary makes. Instead we parade the lack of charisma and military style buffoonery to be hallmarks of Singapore governance: is it because if someone isn’t slick and sophisticated, we should believe him more?</p>

<p>I don’t need Mr Chan to be sleek. I just don’t want to have to do battle with him. I’m not going to win. All he has to do is feed me army food and I will concede defeat.</p>

<p>I’m just a concerned young citizen of this great nation who wants to know if they have any ideas about how they are going to evolve as a party which is quite frankly losing its sheen. Perhaps even its ideas. I <em>want</em> them to concede the space. Move over somewhere and let the other guy talk. Maybe not even the other guy, that may be too much to ask of them for the time being — let <em>some other guy</em> talk. Like the guy who doesn’t want to fight me on the street corner.</p>

<p>I’m not yet convinced that they are completely irrelevant. But I am alarmed by where they are going. For a start I would like them to wean themselves off their addiction to <a href="http://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/agc-versus-me-the-2013-round/">legal action against private citizens</a> who have something to say. That’s not a fight they’re spoiling for; that’s a long-range missile against people who only have fruit to throw at you.</p>

<p>I was hoping to hear more introspection rather than more of the same. The one thing they got right: they must improve their communications.</p>

<p>Because quite frankly I am tired of being told that I read it all wrong*, they didn’t really mean it that way, their words were taken out of context — I sometimes wish they went back to the good old days when they actually knew how to control the media. Now they just look like bumbling idiots.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Someone, somewhere, is going to say that ‘battle’ was just a figure of speech, probably after the ‘netizens’ howl about it. I stand my ground. Say what you mean, pick neutral words, try not to put down anyone while you’re doing it, and if you’re getting it wrong again just read a dictionary.</li>
</ul>

                            <h2><a href="/2013/11/living-with-graves/">Living with Graves</a></h2>

                            <div class="excerpt">
                                <p>A year and a half ago, my friends sent me to a local emergency ward in Singapore when I moved in and out of delirium in the middle of dinner. I had been unwell for a long time, but there had been no suitable diagnosis or treatment. I lost nearly 20 kilograms, had the shakes, became insomniac, and most of all, emotionally and mentally unstable. Once diagnosed, it isn’t a terribly awful disease; but the number of adjustments one has to make is astounding. Friends and loved ones too, struggle with dealing with the external impact of your disease, and will have to do so for a very long time.</p>

<p>To say it can have a dramatic effect on your life may not be an understatement. Nearly every Graves’ patient I know personally has experienced one or all of the above: unplanned career changes, closure or reorganization of business enterprises and any other financial responsibilities, breakdowns of relationships including marriages, and the list doesn’t stop there. Some of your partners or friends will think it is not a big deal and that you are overreacting — after all, it’s just that a tiny butterfly-shaped gland near your throat has elected to produce hormones at a different rate, right?</p>

<p>It could not be more wrong.</p>

<p>That tiny butterfly-shaped gland near your throat is also inscrutable, and controls many aspects of your life and health that you take for granted. One of the key things it affects is your mood, if untreated or treated inadequately. If you’ve always been cheerful, optimistic and bubbly, imagine becoming a different person for hours with no warning whatsoever; breaking down crying when your bus doesn’t arrive, or when your toast is burnt. If you’ve always been confident and dominant, imagine becoming daunted by small tasks you do routinely — and being confused as hell about it. If you’ve always had a superb memory to the point you’ve never had to write anything down to remember them — imagine forgetting, every single time, the door code to get into your office. Every time you go to the bathroom you get locked out from work because your brain just isn’t keeping pace with your body.</p>

<p>Scariest of all: nothing else seems to matter. The business you’ve built for years. The career you’ve devoted your life to. The partner you’ve made plans for life with. It’s so necessary to walk away from all of that, when you aren’t yourself. It’s tempting to think about leaving everything and everyone because nothing’s working anymore and you want no part of it. It’s easier to quit. Which is also weird, especially if you’ve never been a quitter.</p>

<p>I tried, and still try, to lead a normal life. I take my meds everyday, but am constantly thinking about what more I can do. Should I drink radioactive iodine? Remove my thyroid gland completely? I don’t particularly want to do either especially since neither of them have a sure shot or even a good shot at ‘curing’ me, and may potentially work out even worse. I want to eat my meds daily and eventually come to a point when I don’t need them anymore. Most days, a year and a half on, I’m back to being myself — by that meaning a completely different person from when I got diagnosed. A different person from the one that made bad decisions because I did not know the extent of my disease or what it does to me, when I did not know I had the disease at all. Now that I know how it affects my cognitive processes, my emotional lability, my physical body when the symptoms return when in remission — I try not to notice. Most days, I succeed. Yet it never feels like it’s enough.</p>

<p>We still haven’t gotten it right. The meds work and then they don’t. My body, through no input from me, suddenly decides it loves making my heart jump out of my chest when all I’m doing is sitting in a car. My mind decides it wants to react in entirely unwarranted ways: I’m the life of a party one mind and the next moment I can’t even hold a conversation with anyone.</p>

<p>I’m seeking all the best medical help I can get but it’s still an incurable disease that affects everyone differently and in different ways at every stage in your life. I don’t know if I’ll ever be done: all I can do is manage my expectations, and other people’s. I know my limits: if I can’t work, socialize or be normal, I have to make sure people know it isn’t me, it’s just this dumb disease. Sometimes I don’t even know who I am or what’s happening. I’ve come close enough to get to a point where my levels are supposed to be normal, normal enough to get off the meds completely to see what happens next. But even before we can try that, I’m relapsing — like a damned <em>yo yo</em> — and I have no idea what will happen next. It’s a dumb disease.</p>

<p>Just some dumb disease I’ll have forever.</p>
