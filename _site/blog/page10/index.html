    </h2>
    
    <p>I am pleased to announce the launch of <a href="http://www.wethecitizens.sg">WeTheCitizens.sg</a>, a small project following the National Day Rally speeches.</p>

<p><a href="http://winnielim.com">Winnie</a> and I worked on this in the 12 hours after the rally, because we just wanted to find out what people would do to improve Singapore, if they had a voice.</p>

<p>We solicited feedback through the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bettersg&amp;src=typd">#bettersg</a> hashtag, as well as through a web form.</p>

<p>It’s a simple project which is not meant to solve any overarching issues, doesn’t provide solutions, and is guilty perhaps of preaching to the choir. It is also a little too excessively… nationalistic. All these are valid, critical points; I agree with most of them.</p>

<p>However, this is also our small, tentative step into the an exploration of the intersection of technology, politics and activism. What will come out of this? Who knows? I do know, however, that we will perform some basic data analysis on the hashtag archives, which is interesting from a opinion-gathering and technological point of view. We will also create a classroom pack for educators so that they can discuss some of these suggestions.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I personally just want us all to start talking more — whether or not the views are contrarian, populist, rational — I think all viewpoints are important, and this is just our little contribution as geeks who care about this country.</p>

<p>Rain falling on zinc roofs. Neighbours having sex</p>

<p>Hoping they won’t be <em>suay</em> again. They have no money.</p>

<p>The news coming from the sole television set. Children peeping for a glimpse of world affairs. Condensed milk cans</p>

<p>filled with coffee. Ah Ba will have to go to the office.</p>

<p>The office is also a shed. He carries sacks to and fro sheds</p>

<p>All day. Sometimes all night too. Last week someone tried to chop him in the head. He doesn’t care. A bowl of porridge a day makes Ah Ba strong. Insulates him from the world. Protects him from things such as emotions. And cleavers.</p>

<p>If there had been rain yesterday, everything could have been saved. There was no rain. Now there is no television set. No neighbours. No sex. No house. Ah Ma ran everywhere with his two youngest children. They were at the provision shop looking at candy they could not afford. When it happened they ran into temple. Stayed there. Crouched in a corner. Waiting. Shaking. It did not rain. The firemen worked all day. Ah Ba ran from the office shed but he could not find them. He almost cried, but, porridge.</p>

<p>He found them in the temple. Waiting. Shaking. Crouching. Ah Ba held his children tight. But he never found the words.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>As many of you will know by now, I have spent a substantial part of the past decade travelling through India. I still feel like I’m barely done with scratching the surface. There’s just so much to see in that vast, amazing country that I call my second home.</p>

<p>For some time now I’ve wanted to go to Coorg.</p>

<p>Coorg, also known as Kodagu, is a hill area in the state of Karnataka, in the Western Ghats. Its people are known as Kodavas (not Coorgis!) and all I knew about the place was that it had coffee, beautiful people, and pork curry. All that was sufficient to inspire me to plan a trip there.</p>

<p>From Chennai, I took a quick overnight train to Mysore Junction (book early, book ahead — this route is headed towards Bangalore, and therefore sells out early), but you can also take a bus. At Mysore Junction, I arranged for a car to pick me up for breakfast and to my resort of choice.</p>

<p>An acquaintance from Mysore highly recommended <a href="http://www.travelparkz.com/car/script/carpackages.php">Travelparkz</a>, and he was right: they were a very reliable car and driver service, and it was good value. I hired them for a pickup from Mysore Junction railway station to the resort in Coorg that I was headed to; and for a drop-off from the resort to Bangalore city a couple of days later. I highly recommend these guys, though it’s best to reach them via phone. They speak English.</p>

<p>I had heard about <a href="http://www.thetamara.com">The Tamara</a> from friends in Bangalore, so I decided I would give it a shot. It’s a very new place and it gets most things right. My only complaint is it didn’t have as much pork as I would have liked.</p>

<p>You can wander about the grounds of The Tamara on your own, or sign up for one of their daily walks with their on-site naturalist. I did none of the above as I was too busy resting after a long week at work in India!</p>

<p>Highly recommended. I will be returning to Coorg shortly, although I may want to check out  <a href="http://victoryhome.net">Victory Home</a> next, since I’ve just met these guys in Bangalore.</p>

<p>Damn I love this country.</p>

<p><strong><em>Day 1:</em></strong> Two sleep-deprived people board a plane full of evangelical missionaries offering ‘free healing’ in the plane (true story), dinner in the streets and accidental romantic date at a blacksmith-themed cocktail bar with a toilet that was so awesomely creepy it freaked out the one half of us that actually writes horror fiction as a profession. Shai halip in Little Arabia, 24-hour tacos and the latest episode of Scandal.</p>

<p>Street vendors selling holographic pictures of puppies, kittens, Jesus and Mary, naked women and ferocious tigers, across from a fake Viagra/Cialis/ made-in-China sex toy shops.</p>

<p>Bangkok is my happy place. Tomorrow: at least two massages.</p>

<p><strong><em>Day 2:</em></strong> In no particular order: grilled chicken hearts, the breakfast of champions; flashing at passengers on the Khlong San Saeb river taxi each time (not me, btw), having random thai men cat-calling us coz Sam is in a very sessy dress (they called us ‘black and white girls’. Um. Brown and yellow is more accurate); beef boat noodle carnage, talking security guards into letting us trespass private property so we can take a shortcut, Gibson-esque massive overhead bridges, stalker pandas and mushrooms, great crackling massages, pork cracklings;</p>

<p>Pork satay, dogs and teddy bears and dogs in frilly clothes; hanging out with exes, discussing whether one’s Portuguese ancestry is to blame for epic marine vessel conquering flag-planting fantasies (no: it’s just Sam); ominous Elliott Smith songs in hotel toilets, streetside mobile bars. Pork tacos in the fridge.</p>

<p>A swim is on the menu tomorrow. Pandas are everywhere.</p>

<p>Off my rockers/tits high on chilli padi. It was a beautiful yum poo dong – raw blue swimmer crab salad smothered in beautiful chilli – the cold raw crab tastes like crab ice cream. But so off my rockers chilli high coz I am so clever I ordered it extra extra spicy. I love chilli padi highs. So beautiful, this world</p>

<p><strong><em>Day 3:</em></strong> Looking for soi Polo chicken and seeing random chickens and people wearing I ♥ Chicken T-shirts everywhere (surreal), having a crab-gasm over the raw blue swimmer crab in a yum poo dong, coffee in random little sheds in Lumpini, more great massages, Phra Athit jazz and beer and evil plotting, a knock-out pad thai.</p>

<p>Home tomorrow!</p>

<p>Sam and I are at a girlie bar on Nana, showing bar girls pictures of fried crickets. We are looking for the Nana Cricket &amp; Grasshopper street vendor. I don’t know how to say “where are the edible crickets” in Thai. Yet.</p>

<p>Apparently I accidentally cock-blocked an Italian dude at a bar in Bangkok. All I did was drink whisky and talk about apps and their project timelines. A thai MILF then decided to tell me she thinks I must be gay, and proceeded to tell me she used to be butch with many girlfriends until a guy drugged and raped her and she got pregnant. (all this happened in thai)</p>

<p>The Italian dude left, very sadly.</p>

<p>Must. Stop. Accidentally. Fang dian-ing<superscript>*</superscript> at people. Even sideways in my peripheral vision while eating potato chips and drinking whisky.</p>

<p><em>Note: ‘fang dian’ = a Mandarin term made up by some friends, meaning ‘to put electricity’. It refers to my track record of accidentally attracting unwanted attention through what they suspect is the sheer Cyclops-like, err, traits in my… eyes.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Day 4</em></strong>: <em>jok moo</em>! Pork porridge with salted egg, century egg, innards! Flip-flops and Hello Kitty (don’t ask) and cable shopping! Skyfall! Prawn bisque! Accidentally fang-dian-ing: me at people, Sam at buildings! Giant sea creatures! Girlie bars! Mobile bars! No crickets!</p>

<p><strong>New Bangkok Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I still love Bangkok as much now, as I did when I first started frequenting it… circa 2004?</li>
  <li>Oh gawd I feel old these days.</li>
  <li>That’s directly related to how all I want to do these day is have massages. My back creaks; my body creaks along with it. My new go-to place for a massage is at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ruennuadmassage">Ruen Nad</a> massage studio on 42 Convent Road, off Silom. It really is one of the best massages you can have for that little money (1 hour goes for 350 THB). It’s a <em>little</em> pricier than the less fancy places but the masseuses are uniformly great, and the ambience — in a restored old house in a fancy part of Bangkok — is really unbeatable. Also, Convent Road has some of the best street food in that city.</li>
  <li>The row of street stalls next to Sala Daeng BTS station still has a curious mix of gay p0rn and pirated DVDs. The latter tend to be arthouse (non-p0rnographic) movies, including a great many films which are simply just not available online… or in your local video store. The range of movies is quite breathtaking. I love Silom.</li>
  <li>If you are ever in Bangkok, do yourself a favour and eat a meal — go for the degustation — at <a href="http://www.bolan.co.th">Bo.lan</a>. Chefs Bo and Dylan create exquisite food — slow food — and are rather experimental whilst strongly grounded in the traditions. Every meal I have had there, which is still too few, has been revelatory.</li>
  <li>I like the northern neighbourhoods. Victory Monument is home not just to impoverished foreigners/English-teachers, it’s also home to <a href="http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2010/11/restaurant-sud-yod-kuay-teow-reua-best-boat-noodles/">Boat Noodle Alley</a>, a massive Gibson-esque skywalk/pedestrian bridge, as well as to <a href="http://www.saxophonepub.com/">Saxophone jazz bar</a>, which is a reliable spot to kick back with a beer and listen to some great music. I also like the neighbourhood of Ari, which has too many pleasures to name.</li>
  <li>If you like jazz with some fairy dust, <a href="http://travel.cnn.com/bangkok/shop/iron-fairies-bangkoks-latest-it-venue-958296">Iron Fairies</a> is a Dickensian blacksmith workshop restaurant and pub (seriously). It’s beautiful. Think Steampunk meets Dickens meets jazz meets industrial chic. There’s great live jazz featuring local musicians, some nights. We were there on a Monday and it was going strong. The Thonglor neighbourhood that it’s in is also chock-a-block full of great little spots. They tend to tend to lean quite heavily towards ‘hiso’ (the Thai equiv of the Singaporean ‘atas’, with regards to class).</li>
  <li>Hiso/atas is totally fine by me. I like my upper-middle class hipsterism in strong doses. I also need a bit more down low to counteract too much hipsterism, though, and Thonglor does dish out the down low in appropriate amounts too. soi 38 on the other side of the station is packed with great street food, but one of my favourite meals on this trip was at Jok Moo. Like the name suggests it specializes in pork congee. It was quite a battle ordering two bowls of pork congee in the specific configurations we wanted (salted egg and century eggs, one with innards and one without)… in my limited Thai, but my hunger prevailed and we succeeded. The porridge held its own against some of the best Chinese congees in Singapore/Malaysia. They also seem to have solved the age-old problem of never having hot-enough fritters: they have these little packets of fried fritters resembling <em>you tiao</em> but not really, and they’re always cripsy. There is nothing more disgusting than soggy <em>you tiao</em> in your congee, and nothing more wonderful than having congee with fresh, hot fritters as well. It’s one of the biggest conundrums I think I face as a Chinese person: would I rather eat soggy fritters or not eat any at all?</li>
  <li>Jok Moo is at the start of Sukh soi 38. Alight at Thonglor station and head for the even-numbered side. Locate soi 38. Jok Moo is the first corner shop on the right at the start of the soi, after some watch or hardware shops. It only has Thai words written on its signage. There’s some seating at the back. Have the lemongrass drink. Basic English is understood here. Pointing helps, if all else fails.</li>
  <li>The <em>pad thai</em> at Thipsamai on Mahachai Road really is what it’s cracked up to be. A tip: don’t order the version with the shrimp oil. I love my calories and I love my oily fried noodles in all shapes and sizes, but the shrimp oil really kicked me in the guts… after. They also have a new dish: <em>pad thai</em> without the noodles. If Mos Burger can do burgers with lettuce instead of buns, I guess Thipsamai can do <em>pad thai</em> without the noodles. Although both food concepts totally go against every fibre of my being.</li>
  <li>The fried chicken at Soi Polo, off Wireless Road near Lumpini. Run, don’t walk. Also order the <em>yum poo dong</em> — the cold crab salad that gave me the chilli high described above. Both are beautiful. The Star Trek movie dubbed in Thai, not so much.</li>
  <li>One day I will find the fabled coconut ice cream at Sam Yan.</li>
  <li>Did I do anything other than eat in Bangkok? We watched James Bond. Took photos with giant sea creatures. Introduced Sam to grilled chicken heart breakfasts, and to the river boat experience I love (the commuter Klong San Saeb, not the one on the tourist trail).</li>
  <li>Bangkok is still one of my favourite Asian cities and I don’t understand how anybody can ever hate it. Well, I do — it’s not for everyone. But if you like hulking, in-your-face Asian metropolises like I do, Bangkok is It.</li>
  <li>One day I will make a concerted effort to get better at my Thai.</li>
</ul>

    <p>I’ve thrown myself headlong into work — real work, and then foundation work.</p>

<p>India is an important part of my life and I owe everything to her. Over the past couple of months, my friends and I have been busy putting a little NGO together, the <a href="http://gyanada.org">Gyanada Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Today (Tues, 12 March) between 7 and 9 in the evening, I’ll be hosting our soft launch at Artistry, 17 Jalan Pinang.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/358507430931310/">event details</a>! Hope to see you there.</p>
