        <title>Do What You Don't Know</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Like so many people who grew up with the Internet, there have been many incarnations of my online self. To some, I will forever be the queer blogger who started writing about the lesbian experience as a teenager in Singapore in the early 2000s. Some find that courageous; I found it much more difficult to change pronouns than to pretend to be someone I was not. To others, I am a travel blogger who enjoys hiking across Asia on trains, bikes and boats. That is made possible by a blend of courage and stupidity, and it has served me well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On The Spectrum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s it like to be on the spectrum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is to be able to do wonderfully complex and abstract things, at the speed of light, yet to be stumped at how to give straightforward directions to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be diagnosed after the age of 30 is to learn quite resolutely: the weirdest feature in my being is not who I am, but what I do not understand. I do not understand what is easily understood by most. But I have done a good job pretending I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People expect me to understand because I manage to pass for somebody I am not: well put together. In charge of my mind and body. Able to hold a conversation, fill rooms with hundreds of people. Capable of making inferences and deductions based on fact and feeling. Able to pass for ‘neurotypical’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent conversations like the ones I’ve had to pay a lot of money to have some obvious things pointed out to me, I’ve had to dig into the recesses of my psyche. Things I thought I’d scrubbed out of my brain and consciousness. I did not have to go back very far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in my head, suspended between my thoughts and reality. In my head, I have already raced through the day’s tasks elegantly, solving one interesting problem after another. In reality, I struggle to put on my shoes. Five year old me’s daily problem: no matter how hard I try, I cannot  will my fingers to arrange my shoelaces and straps in a manner that makes sense. This still happens to me. In my head, I may have made spreadsheets upon spreadsheets to address every question I have thought of while showering in the morning. In reality, I cannot will an arrangement of words and numbers to show up without brute force. This tires me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At social events it would be nice, of course, to finally understand how to moderate my speech or behaviour to match what is expected of polite company. But I am interested only in a very tiny set of topics. It helps then to not know what it feels like to pass for social; I have only ever managed to wager a guess. Since I do not know how that feels like, I do not know how to want those things, which is often mistaken for apathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was to have made mathematical calculations of my romantic odds instead of caring for people on an individual level. For that, I am sorry. All of those times people asked me on OkCupid or Tinder what I was looking for and I said ‘an algorithmic match’, I thought it was the only thing to say. And if we actually dated, I was still looking for the algorithms and my mainframe was out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being on the spectrum means I grapple with simple questions: the one which terrifies me most, even to this day is — how are you? There is a five second delay in which I think, how, am, wait, what does that mean and who am I? Am I good today? Is that the truth? Am I more good than the last time I was asked this weird question? It feels like an infinite loop. Asking me how I am or how I feel, is no different from being asked to reach into the bottom of my soul and finding no difference between one abyss and another. How am I? How do I feel? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In place of feelings, there are patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is the pattern of ‘everybody is smiling am I more convincing at making eye contact now or am I still failing’. This sometimes looks like I have too many feelings, or that I have none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are the patterns of ‘this looks like something which has happened before which leads me to conclude… Something’ and ‘oh shit I got it terribly wrong’. There are few patterns in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been lucky to find my feet in a career that skews unfairly towards people on the spectrum, but the parts of it: the speaking at conferences, the socializing and networking, the parties, the world of people talking to and understanding each other, that I shudder at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be on the spectrum is to have few tools for anger and other emotional processes. How is someone else feeling? I can only wager a guess. It is to disproportionately over-emphathise (because it seems like that’s what people do), or to do too little of it. For me, it is also to be completely incapacitated in the in-betweens: what is not said. Even then, what is said can also have the same effect when it is said in a different way — that matches another pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like living in a bad torrent. It is a blockbuster movie to everyone else who somehow always finds a way to watch the IMAX version. But yours resembles a pirated movie torrent with an audio track that is 10 seconds out of sync — ahead. It all sounds like gibberish, and there are somehow no subs of the right language and container size and codec. You have to watch it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, the other movie is coming into focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ll never be able to see all of it in high fidelity, but — I’m told it is up to people like us to find new standards of definition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wordpress to Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If this looks bare to you, it’s supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just finished archiving all of my old posts and giving them some new life as something else they’re not: cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;, this setup lets me edit the site in a way I must prefer now: with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io&quot;&gt;text editor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most things are still here, and I’ll add to it shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes less is more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re into that sort of thing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skinnylatte/skinnylatte.github.io&quot;&gt;check out my repo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What 31 Feels Like</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wonderful but sometimes a downer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comfortable but invigorating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stable but enervating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun but sometimes mild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energetic and delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World-changing and domestic, depending on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upwards trajectory but sometimes down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;31 is about being happy in my own skin: that it’s really okay to have greasy hair and over-sized T-shirts, when you have your dog and your partner by your side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the most wonderful year, to everyone who has played a role in it. I am lucky and grateful to have all of you by my side.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Panic at the Disco</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gay clubs were for flowers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: I wrote this piece before we learned more about what happened. I’m sorry about misgendering or mis-identifying the victims.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 31 in a few months. Not old, but old enough to remember how &lt;em&gt;coming out&lt;/em&gt; was not on Tumblr, it was at Taboo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would go with my best friends, all of us so drawn to each other (boys and girls) because we saw a spark of — what was it? We thought it was &lt;em&gt;weirdness&lt;/em&gt; at the time — in each other. It was a badge nobody gave us, but we saw on ourselves anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only someone could have told us: this badge, it is a badge of queerness. Use it well, do not sleep with worthless people, and you’ll be okay. One day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did the Orlando shootings reverberate across the world as I knew it — on the walls, timelines, of every queer person I know, and their allies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of &lt;em&gt;safe spaces&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;sanctity&lt;/em&gt;, kept coming up. Weird, perhaps to consider something like a sweaty, sweltering gay club sacred. But it was. And will always be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I never felt like I was of “the scene” (there was literally nothing for me there), being a woman, outnumbered with my persuasions out-persuaded, it was, in so many ways, where I found myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a terrible dancer, but some alcohol with the encouragement of men who don’t care about sleeping with me, made gay clubs the only place I felt safe. I didn’t have to worry about men, even if I went alone. And most times, I did. In Singapore, in Bangkok, in Helsinki, in every place I have called home or visited for longer than a day. A gay club had always found itself on my itinerary. It was my window into the pulse of the rebels, the misfits, the mostly straight but didn’t want to be fag hags I could sometimes persuade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, the complete sense of belonging and the unadulterated self. There, I could be myself, long before I could be that person at school, at home, in my places of worship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Omar Mateen went into a gay club halfway across the world, spraying bullets and quite literally hunting down gay people, my memories merged into one, as it did for many queer people everywhere. He didn’t kill 50 gays in one club, he reached into, placed himself in, and ripped up the &lt;em&gt;safe space&lt;/em&gt; we have all found. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how to explain a safe space to people who have never needed one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18, venturing out timidly with my best friends. Seeing educators; kissing each other (of the opposite gender) to pretend, badly, that we were all straight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20, between life milestones, trembling and swooning every time an older women “picked me” (hahaha, I was very young and very hot; they should have been swooning instead).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently in life, being protected and cared for by wonderful gay men in cities all over the world. From Istanbul to Helsinki and San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not just 50 gay men that Omar Mateen killed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all of us on the dance floor. The veteran gays who go to see friends and dance with them. The young man peeking out from his closet, having to hide his queer clothes in his bag. His career as a hot young stud, vanished. The fag hags who love the gay men they cannot have. The old couples who go because they want to believe they still got it. The amazing dancers. The not so good ones. The long lines for the men’s toilets; the lack of one, of the lack of a toilet, for women. The bad vodka. The cheap rum. The smell of leather and sweat. The promise of darkness and kink — but is it really that dark or kinky if you were the one getting it? The camaraderie. The cliquey lesbians who think anyone talking to their girlfriends is infidelity, even when gay men do it. The stolen kisses once outside. The sobering effect of a greasy meal early in the morning when you didn’t meet someone interesting or you made the right choices in life. Kebabs and Chinese food. Drunk friends you send home vowing to never let them drink again. The sullen faces that sometimes harbour disgust the moment you walk out of the door knowing you will not be accepted outside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where Omar Mateen took us all. He sprayed his evil bullets into our sanctuary, hiding his last minutes in the toilet of a gay club. Let that sink in for a minute. Possibly the worst homophobe the world has seen since the Holocaust. And he hides out in a gay club toilet before he dies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All across the world violent acts are performed on minorities every day. Queer people are persecuted. Women are beaten. Trans people are murdered. Immigrants are hunted. Other ethnic and religious groups including atheists are tortured, hated, cussed at. What you think is casual racism, homophobia, transphobia, funny jokes that won’t hurt anyone, magnifies with a weapon in its hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve ever stopped to say, _why are you people demanding your rights? It’s a playbook from Western activists wanting to erode our culture! What next, marriage? Yes. _We are demanding to not be massacred. To not be spat on and beaten &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kbdNh6p8RKo&quot;&gt;in Albania&lt;/a&gt;. To be not pistol-whipped and left to die on a fence &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.denverpost.com/2009/10/01/murderer-matt-shepard-needed-killing/&quot;&gt;in Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;. To be not raped — correctively and incorrectly — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/crisis-in-south-africa-the-shocking-practice-of-corrective-rape-aimed-at-curing-lesbians-9033224.html&quot;&gt;in South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. To not be kidnapped by your parents and sent to “pray the gay away” camps, all over the world where evangelical Christians have found money and warped theology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are here and we are queer. Do not kill us like deer. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kolkata Kalling</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://res.cloudinary.com/dmchbvarm/image/upload/v1464695044/32572077_fc88a27348_o_mnpexg.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-1295&quot; title=&quot;Kolkata 2004&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;429&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;12 years ago in Kolkata. At the time still much referred to as Calcutta. Now less so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city doesn’t change; but you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/skinnylatte/albums/724396&quot;&gt;Every picture&lt;/a&gt; I have of it from 12 years ago still looks like it could have been from December, when I last visited. Perhaps even today. When I land at midnight later, there will not be the crisp, muddled air of the winters I love in that city, just the night time counterpart to the heat that I know will pound on my face, and the ground, sometime in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that I know, all that I do, I owe it to this city, even if it will never know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my school friends were road-tripping across European cities for ‘summer break’, or perhaps even the big cities of China and America for work and school, I found solace &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;. It can be hard to see, but Kolkata is a hard act to beat. It’s the &lt;em&gt;ultimate summer&lt;/em&gt;. Followed by monsoon. And the sounds of….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a monsoon and the rain lifts lids off cars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Spinning buses like toys, stripping them to chrome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Across the bay, the waves are turning into something else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore — James, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejU5YAHN3vQ&quot;&gt;Sometimes&lt;/a&gt; (which somehow always comes to mind when I think of this place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to beat it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start, really, of &lt;em&gt;empire&lt;/em&gt;. The fall, or rather the fading away, of one. The majesty of India’s cricketing hopes and dreams, and occasionally the dashing of, projected unto Eden Gardens even when the matches aren’t in season. The death of Marxism, available for the world to see at every &lt;em&gt;adda&lt;/em&gt; and every failing piece of infrastructure. Tagore’s poetry. Indian Coffee House. The children of Tollygunge, who taught me so much, 12 years ago. Sandesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://res.cloudinary.com/dmchbvarm/image/upload/v1464698896/126293771_b3365e24fa_o_t8yrik.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-1302&quot; title=&quot;Kolkata Fish Monger&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On hot afternoons when the sun hits the ground and meets engine oil, the smell reminds me of my first love among the many other putrid Asian cities I have come to love:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So in the streets of Calcutta I sometimes imagine myself a foreigner, and only then do I discover how much is to be seen, which is lost so long as its full value in attention is not paid. It is the hunger to really see which drives people to travel to strange places.” — Tagore, My Reminiscences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This foreigner is not done discovering.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Small Rooms with Betawi Women</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Not for the first time, I found myself in a tiny room on a hot day, the youngest among old women. Each with a different thing to say to me, also the only person not from around these parts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re so old now! And unmarried!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your hair is too white! Eat more soy beans!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One woman rubbed my tattoos, making a screechy sound with her teeth, before announcing to all the other old women around her: “these are real.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No judgement, no scorn – I was local enough to be in a place like that, but not local enough to be judged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can you bring me some white chocolate next time you come, girl? I had them once and only in your country (Singapore). I’ve never had them since.” She rubbed my back some more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At places like these old women collectively talk, soothe each other’s tired or injured muscles, and together not give a damn about anything outside of those doors. At least for an hour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went often to places like these, my severe back pains often needing urgent attention from anything that would give them rest. In Jakarta, I am a frequent visitor to Haji Naim – a group of famed healers in the Betawi community. I figured that if it didn’t work there was at least delicious soto Betawi to be had next door. Now that I come here so often, a massage almost always precedes a lovely bowl of soup and beef. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been glad to have the ability and opportunity to bond with old women anywhere in the world – their wisdom and unlikely sorority is what I look forward to, whether in Yemen or India or Singapore. Here, the Betawi women took turns rubbing my tattoos, shrieking when they discovered (repeatedly) that they were real. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my time in this city has been about discovering, for the first time, scenes that played such a large part in my youth. Hot afternoons with old Indonesian women. Dusk on the street with teenagers singing with their guitars. Children begging. Families living under bridges. The Indonesian movies that used to play so often in my tiny, hot Singaporean shoebox apartment, now alive in parts of the city. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet the other parts of it are real, too. Large gleaming buildings. New shiny things. Cocktails as expensive as Singapore’s. Malls full of only imported things. My feet in both worlds: one in the village and one in Pacific Place. One in meetings with fancy people, another under the firm thumbing of extremely old women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a difficult balance to keep up, but I enjoy each moment. White chocolate in Betawi houses; going home to my $5 room after a day out in $5 coffee houses. Improbable things and inevitable places. As I chug along at work and in life, I’m relieved to have the opportunity to make things work again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When I Was Young</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m seated now by the side of an old vending machine in Jakarta airport, with power sockets so dirty and old I had to think twice about plugging my cables in. Yet in all of Terminal 1, one of the oldest airport terminals in a country not known for modern aviation facilities, there was only this one socket free. Confined to my fate of temporarily sharing power with a giant Teh Botol (not Coke!) machine with no seat within range of my Macbook charger, I am, obviously, on the floor yet again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting on floors: a practice cultivated in many countries across the world. Sometimes involuntary, most of the time because my inner hippie wants me to. The difference between now and then — I am now at the kind of age where you would, if you did not know me, expect some kind of manners from me. Wear proper clothes, wear proper shoes. Sit on proper surfaces. I imagined I would too! That one day, I would finally learn how to be &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt;. How wrong I was on that, and many other fronts! I am happy to &lt;em&gt;still-sitting-on-dirty-floors&lt;/em&gt;. No — I am overjoyed. Overjoyed to be still a &lt;em&gt;chapalang, anyhow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;anyhowly chapalang&lt;/em&gt; person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much has happened since the last real post of any substance here. Mid, early 2014 perhaps. I started a company. It still lives. I have teams, collaborators, all across my different endeavours. The foundation I started in 2012 is still alive, too. I am relieved and grateful for all of the opportunities thrown my way, all of the paths revealed and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I not write? I did not write, because life overwhelmed me and kept me away and sometimes light-headed. I did not write, because I forgot how to. It isn’t like riding a bicycle — it’s more of riding a unicycle where you know eventually you’ll find your balance but only after falling flat on your face anyway, no matter how many times you’ve ridden one. In my pursuit of achievements, exceptional or otherwise, prizes, awards, Silicon Valley-style work yourself to the bone for some big undefined payoff (emotional or otherwise); I lost myself in the race. I lost myself, too, in the unclear idea of what it meant to be an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An adult, I was told, lived in a proper house with a proper bed with a proper pillow (for all of the neck pains you’re bound to have). I have neck pains, indeed, but realise I can do without all of the rest. I haven’t sat on dirty airport floors for years. I haven’t gone somewhere with nothing in my bag other than the clothes currently on me, in years. I haven’t gone somewhere without a plan, without a place to stay, without any idea of what i was going to do. I don’t know how else to live, and forcing myself into being the opposite of those things brought me further and further away from who I really was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this year, after learning to like myself again, I’ll finally get my groove back again. I’m proud to be an &lt;em&gt;anyhowly&lt;/em&gt; person. I’m proud to extreme and spontaneous. I will no longer knead the image of who I truly am into the uninspiring ideas of what some people had wanted me to become. I don’t want to achieve things for the sake of doing that — I want to learn to be alive, again. Let’s see how we go on this journey, I’m excited but also shit-scared about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I once believed (when I was much younger) — if it doesn’t scare me like hell, it probably isn’t worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Said airport power sharing setup &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://popagandhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_1941.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://popagandhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_1941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is the Self-Hosted Blog Dead?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fuck Medium. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had enough of their terrible user interface, narrow writing experience, and the empty platitudes of ‘recs’ and comments from people looking to improve their lives by reading inspiring content from people they don’t care about. Worst of all? I hate people whining about Millennials more than Millennials themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this site precisely so that I could tinker around under the hood, and that’s what I’ve missed — tinkering. Writing. Slapping together bits of random code you find on the internet (now forking random folks’ code on Github) and hoping it would work. I know a lot more about code and development processes now, but I still gain a huge amount of happiness from tinkering with things I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My archives are in a mess. I stopped writing here some time circa 2010. I don’t know why. Life took over. I got lazy. I got fed up trying to do everything at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might take some time to gather the things I posted on different parts of the web. But it should be worth it 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
