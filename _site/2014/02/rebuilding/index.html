        <p>1.</p>

<p>Almost exactly two years ago I was, too, on a flight to India.</p>

<p>Only then I did not know exactly how drastic a turn my life would take on when I returned.</p>

<p>2.</p>

<p>More and more of my friends are getting diagnosed with diseases similar to mine. Autoimmune diseases are the new black.</p>

<p>Across all of these experiences the one we’ve all had has been the extreme upheaval in all of our emotional lives.</p>

<p>3.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if the person who made those decisions at the time was me, or the severely impaired bodily part that’s wreaked havoc in my head and my heart.</p>

<p>Even if the conclusions are the same in the end, I would still like to know that I had some control. But I did not.</p>

<p>4.</p>

<p>There is nothing I hate more than feeling like my self-determinism, even if it doesn’t really exist, has been impinged upon.</p>

<p>Even if the other person making decisions for me was just a temporarily damaged version of myself.</p>

<p>5.</p>

<p>I’ve spent almost two years rebuilding my life.</p>

<p>I’ve subjected it to some pretty extreme versions of what it could have been and can be, and now I’ve chosen the version I like best.</p>

<p>I like this one.</p>

<p>6.</p>

<p>This one:</p>

<p>This one is happy and confident, pushing 30.</p>

<p>This one is writing more, and better.</p>

<p>This one has had a handful of career highlights and is working harder to create the sorts of situations and opportunities that will define the next decade; it’s within grasp.</p>

<p>This one has an incredible support system in Singapore, Malaysia, India and all around the world and feels like the luckiest person in the world to experience such love.</p>

<p>This one has a loving, intact family. A beautiful dog. A lovely house in a magical part of the city that she loves more and more. A slew of projects taking shape.</p>

<p>This one is learning to finish what she’s started.</p>

<p>7.</p>

<p>That girl is an anomaly, someone told me.</p>

<p>She should terrify you — and amaze you.</p>

<p>She does.</p>

<p>8.</p>

<p>I’ve struggled to articulate what I feel whenever I return to the city I once lived in.</p>

<p>It is a living museum of my loves and losses.</p>

<p>It is a diptych where one side is the city that I once knew and the other is the one I no longer do.</p>

<p>Time has stopped for me in that city. But I am learning to love it again <em>after</em>.</p>

<p>9.</p>

<p>I had an argument with someone recently.</p>

<p>She believed all of these feelings come from unresolved pain — but she was wrong about nearly everything in the end.</p>

<p>10.</p>

<p>The city that is a living museum of love and loss merely preserves them so I can learn to love again.</p>

<p>The streets I walked in in them will never be the same.</p>

<p>Just as it should be possible to hold two opposing positions at once so as to form a better informed opinion, so too should it be possible to hold multiple feelings simultaneously so that we can love better.</p>

<p>For now I pick: terrifying, amazing.</p>

<p>Life’s too short for compromises. I’m too fond of jumping off boats then learning to swim, anyway.</p>
